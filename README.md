# Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the RMS Titanic disaster using Python and basic machine learning techniques. The model helps understand which factors contributed most to survival.

## 🎯 Objective
- To analyze the Titanic dataset and identify key factors influencing survival.
- To build a machine learning model to predict survival outcomes.

## 🗂 Dataset
- Passenger information includes features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, etc.
- The dataset is sourced from Kaggle-style Titanic data.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training & Evaluation  
5. Prediction

## 📈 Key Insights
- Survival likelihood depends on factors such as gender and passenger class.
- Visualizations show correlations between features and survival outcomes.

## 🧠 Conclusion
This project strengthens understanding of supervised machine learning classification and data interpretation skills, which are valuable in analytics roles.
